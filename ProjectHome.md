## Description ##

EDK is a Software Development Kit composted of five [Tools](Tools.md) that helps a developer to write emulators. It provides...

  * a **compiler** that'll turn each emulated device (CPU, video, etc) into a DLL
  * a **graphical interface** that provides a automatically built debugger for each device
  * a **set of functions** ([API](APIReference.md)) that provides the basic operations of every emulator (access to memory, drawing pixels on screen, etc)

Emulators built with EDK currently run in Windows and Linux.

A simple [Atari 2600](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600) emulator is included in the source code as example.
